## Overview
This is a project providing gentoo stage4's as of the definition by the official gentoo wiki although it tweaks that a bit and is not only a basic tarball which provides a bootable system it's a complete tarball giving new users a desktop expierence like ubuntu etc.

## Tested Desktop Environments

Currently, We have tested:

Cinnamon (Works Perfectly)

KDE (Works Perfectly on X11 but Wayland is buggy)

TDE (Works perfectly from temporary usage)

Pantheon (Works fine from the stable branch although testing seems broken)

Deepin (Entirely broken not able to get installed unless heavy modifications to the ebuilds or complete new ones)

LXQT (Works perfectly)

LXDE (Works Perfectly)

Unity7 (Works perfectly from the stable branch testing was not tested)
